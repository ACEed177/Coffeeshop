                    <p>No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, however there are numerous myths and legends about its origin.</p>

                <div class="content_2">
                    <p>Coffee can be traced back to the Ethiopian plateau. An Ethiopian legend states that a goat herder, Kaldi, first discovered the potential of coffee beans when his goats, after eating the berries from a specific tree, became extremely
                        energic and they didn't want to sleep at night. After that Kaldi shared this newly acquired knowledge with others and that's how the beans became popular.</p>

                    <p>Coffee cultivation and exchange began on the Arabian Peninsula. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in coffee houses too - called <i>qahveh khaneh</i> - which began to appear in the Near East. They also performed all kinds
                        of social activies in the coffe houses, such as listening to music, playing chess, keeping up with the news.</p>

                <div class="content_4">
                    <p>European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of the unusual dark black beverage. This happening in the 17th century, some people were suspicious about the beverage, and called it the "bitter invention of Satan". Due to
                        the controversy, Pope Clement VIII decided to taste coffee, and he found the drink so satisfying that he gave it a papal approval. </p>

                    <p>From that point coffee began to spread even faster, and plantations appeared all around the world.</p>
